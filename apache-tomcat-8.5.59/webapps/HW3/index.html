<p>Welcome to the website of the Computer Science Department at George Mason University! With 50 faculty members, the CS Department at Mason is the largest department in the Volgenau School of Engineering, one of the largest departments on campus, and one of the largest CS departments in the Commonwealth of Virginia.

Today, not only are computing devices pervasive in society, but computational methods are used in almost every field of endeavor ranging from the arts and humanities to the hard sciences and engineering. Given the importance of computing in today's world, we strongly support the goal of "Computing for All", i.e., to providing a diverse array of programs and courses in computing to students from all backgrounds and of all levels.

The department offers two Bachelor of Science programs  with a total enrollment of over 1800 students:  the B.S. in Computer Science and the inter-disciplinary B.S. in Applied Computer Science; four M.S. programs in Computer Science, Information Systems, Information Security and Assurance, and Software Engineering with a total enrollment of 350 students; and a Ph.D. program in Computer Science with over 100 students. The department's faculty also teach and participate in the inter-disciplinary M.S. in Data Analytics Engineering and the Ph.D. in Information Technology offered by the Volgenau School of Engineering.</p>
